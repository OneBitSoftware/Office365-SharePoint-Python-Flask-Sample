# Office365-SharePoint-Python-Flask-Sample

# Flask and SharePoint is Fun!  
# If you are not familiar with Flask, I highly recommend it for small projects with tight deadlines http://flask.pocoo.org/.
# I have created Python/Flask app that allows to upload  file in Office365 SharePoint site Document Library. 
# It is inspired by Django sample http://dev.office.com/code-samples-detail/2139 in the office samples. 
# I decided to create similar, but with Flask and also cut a bit of the educational code that is in the sample. 
# So I was able lift up the Python/Flask Provider-Hosted app in Azure and to connect to Office365 SharePoint site with less than 100
# lines of code :). How cool is that!

# Created for testing and presentation purposes. Should not be used in production in this raw state.
